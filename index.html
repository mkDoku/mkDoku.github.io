<p>Hello friend! <br>
Did you ever want to use a library of your favorite programming language, but the
tutorials and documentations were outdated, too few, nonexistent or just some minimally
documented API references?</p>
<p> If so, this blog is for you. <br>
With my blog posts <a href="/about.html">I</a> want to provide
straightforward tutorials about various interesting and useful libraries.
For this, <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and
<a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> are my programming languages
of choice, but blog posts in other languages (e.g. <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++">C++<a>, <a
      href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, â€¦) may follow. <br>
These blog post will remove some of the frustrations exploring a new library,
especially when proper documentation is missing.
However, my blog will not solely feature libraries with poor documentation, but also
extend the already existing set of tutorials out there. The more the merrier, right? <br>
<p> Most importantly, I am writing the blog posts as I am making myself familiar with
these libraries and thus experiencing the troubles of a novice. I am interested in
improving both my programming and documentation skills - so, please help and
<a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> with any kind of suggestions! </p>
